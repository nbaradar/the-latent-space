Showing how to set up and configure quartz with obsidian. And also how to easily host it with GitHub Pages/Netfliy/CloudFlare

# Local Setup
## Quartz 3 Instructions (Hugo Based)
Create a new Vault for Quartz Website. I called it `quartz-vault`
Downloaded Quartz files from github and put the `quartz-site` folder into your `quartz-vault`

Quartz runs on Hugo, so the next step would be to download hugo:
```bash
brew install hugo

hugo version
hugo v0.147.8+extended+withdeploy darwin/arm64 BuildDate=2025-06-07T12:59:52Z VendorInfo=brew
```
Make sure version returns with something. 

Next navigate to where your `quartz-site` folder is with a terminal
```bash
cd /Users/naderbaradar/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/quartz-vault/quartz-site/
ls
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md	docs			quartz
Dockerfile		globals.d.ts		quartz.config.ts
LICENSE.txt		index.d.ts		quartz.layout.ts
README.md		package-lock.json	tsconfig.json
content			package.json
```

Then simply run site on an Hugo server:
```bash
hugo server
```

## Quartz 4 Instructions (Next.js + Typescript)
Navigate to where your `quartz-site` folder is with a terminal
```bash
cd /Users/naderbaradar/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/quartz-vault/quartz-site/
ls
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md	docs			quartz
Dockerfile		globals.d.ts		quartz.config.ts
LICENSE.txt		index.d.ts		quartz.layout.ts
README.md		package-lock.json	tsconfig.json
content			package.json
```

Now clone the official quartz github repo, navigate to the quartz folder, and install all dependencies with `npm i`. Then initialize the quartz project.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git
cd quartz
npm i
npx quartz create
```

Then we need to set up our Quartz repo in Github. Do **not** initialize the new repository with `README`, license, or `gitignore` files.

Next, list your git remotes in your local quartz git repo:
```bash
git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git (push)
```

If your origin is not the repo you just created on GitHub, change it:
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:nbaradar/quartz-vault.git

git remote -v
origin	git@github.com:nbaradar/quartz-vault.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:nbaradar/quartz-vault.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git (push)
```

**MAKE SURE** the upstream remote is set to `https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git` so you can get updates.

Test the updates by issuing the `npx quartz sync --no-pull` command:
```bash
npx quartz sync --no-pull

 Quartz v4.5.1

```
> [!info] In future updates, you can simply run `npx quartz sync` every time you want to push updates to your repository.

Added `index` and `testpage` markdown files in the `quartz -> content` folder using obsidian. REMEMBER [[#Things to note|FRONTMATTER]].

Sync with github so it shows up (just do `npx quartz sync`):

Now you can try building it locally. Navigate to the root of your quartz folder and run the app:
``` bash
npx quartz build --serve

 Quartz v4.5.1  

Cleaned output directory `public` in 1ms
Found 2 input files from `content` in 6ms
Parsed 2 Markdown files in 59ms
Filtered out 0 files in 20μs
Emitted 18 files to `public` in 876ms
Done processing 2 files in 944ms
Started a Quartz server listening at http://localhost:8080
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` and you should see your test page in the browser:

## Publishing your notes on GitPages
It's actually very easy, just follow [this guide](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/hosting#github-pages). 

Once you are done, you can go to your repos Settings, then to Pages in the left tab and you'll see your sites URL

You need to add this to the top of any page inside of the content folder if you want it to render. `draft: false` is critical. This plugin is called [Frontmatter](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/plugins/Frontmatter).
