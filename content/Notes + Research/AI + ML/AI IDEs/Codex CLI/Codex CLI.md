# Additional Tips and Tricks
>[!error]- Why does `o3` or `o4-mini` not work for me?
>It's possible that your [API account needs to be verified](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10910291-api-organization-verification) in order to start streaming responses and seeing chain of thought summaries from the API. If you're still running into issues, please let us know!

>[!info]- Which models are supported?
>Any model available with [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses). The default is `o4-mini`, but pass `--model gpt-4.1` or set `model: gpt-4.1` in your config file to override.
## [Memory & Project Docs](https://github.com/openai/codex?tab=readme-ov-file#memory--project-docs)
You can give Codex extra instructions and guidance using `AGENTS.md` files. Codex looks for `AGENTS.md` files in the following places, and merges them top-down:

1. `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` - personal global guidance
2. `AGENTS.md` at repo root - shared project notes
3. `AGENTS.md` in the current working directory - sub-folder/feature specifics

Disable loading of these files with `--no-project-doc` or the environment variable `CODEX_DISABLE_PROJECT_DOC=1`.
## Tracing / verbose logging
Setting the environment variable `DEBUG=true` prints full API request and response details:
```shell
DEBUG=true codex
```
