First all we do is run 
```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

You can run `npm list --global` to validate that it installed correctly. You should see it listed as an installed package:
```txt
/Users/naderbaradar/.nvm/versions/node/v22.16.0/lib
├── @google/gemini-cli@0.1.7
├── @openai/codex@0.1.2505172129
├── corepack@0.32.0
└── npm@10.9.2
```

Next, you need to set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable. 
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

To find your API key, log into [The OpenAPI Platform](https://auth.openai.com/log-in)

**Do not share your API key** with others or expose it in the browser or other client-side code.

You can test to make sure your API key was set with this command:
```bash
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
```

Then finally, simply issue this `codex` command
```bash
codex
```

And that's it! You should see the interface and can begin prompting
