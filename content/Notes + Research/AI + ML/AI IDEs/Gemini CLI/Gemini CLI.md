**Gemini CLI** just brings the [[Gemini]] family of Models to your terminal. 

It's similar to [[Useful Tools|Warp]] in terms of the AI assisted terminal aspect. (by the way if someone random is reading this, I highly recommend Warp as a general terminal). **BUT the biggest difference is the AI usage requests per month.**

Warp allows for:
- 150 AI requests / MONTH
- Choice between Claude Sonnet 4, OpenAI o3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro

Whereas Gemini CLI: 
- 1,000 AI requests / DAY
- 60 AI requests / MINUTE
- 1 million token Context Window

# Additional Tips/Tricks
## Using `GEMINI.md`
You can create a markdown file in the root directory of your project (wherever you ran `gemini` cli from). When the session starts, the file it automatically ingested and used as context. 

You should aim to include the following context in the `GEMINI.md` file:
```markdown
   * **Project Overview:** A brief description of the project, its purpose, and the technologies used.
   * **Build & Run Commands:** How to build, run, and serve the application.
   * **Test Commands:** How to run the test suite.
   * **Linting & Formatting:** Commands to check and fix code style.
   * **Directory Structure:** An overview of the key directories and what they contain.
   * **Architectural Patterns:** Notes on the project's architecture (e.g., "Uses Repository Pattern," "Microservices architecture").
   * **Coding Conventions:** Specific rules or library preferences (e.g., "Always use axios for HTTP requests," "Prefer functional components in React").
```

>> # Project: My Awesome App
> 
> This is a full-stack web application using React for the frontend and Node.js/Express for the backend.
> 
> ## Commands
> 
> - **Run development server:** `npm run dev`
> - **Run tests:** `npm test`
> - **Lint files:** `npm run lint`
> - **Build for production:** `npm run build`
> 
> ## Key Directories
> 
> - `src/components/`: Contains reusable React components.
> - `src/pages/`: Next.js page routes.
> - `src/server/api/`: Backend API route handlers.
> - `prisma/`: Prisma schema and database configuration.
> 
> ## Conventions
> 
> - Use TypeScript for all new code.
> - State management is handled by Zustand.
> - All API endpoints must be validated using Zod schemas.
> - Follow Material Design principles for UI.

# Use Cases
Directly from the GitHub ReadMe:
>- Query and edit large codebases in and beyond Gemini's 1M token context window.
>- Generate new apps from PDFs or sketches, using Gemini's multimodal capabilities.
>- Automate operational tasks, like querying pull requests or handling complex rebases.
>- Use tools and MCP servers to connect new capabilities, including [media generation with Imagen, Veo or Lyria](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-creative-studio/tree/main/experiments/mcp-genmedia)
>- Ground your queries with the [Google Search](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/grounding) tool, built in to Gemini.
