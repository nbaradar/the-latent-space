The Context Window (or Context Length) refers to the amount of text, in tokens, that a [[Large Language Model]] can consider or "remember" at any one time. 

An LLM’s context window can be thought of as the equivalent of its working memory. It determines how long of a conversation it can carry out without forgetting details from earlier in the exchange. It also determines the maximum size of documents or code samples that it can process at once.
