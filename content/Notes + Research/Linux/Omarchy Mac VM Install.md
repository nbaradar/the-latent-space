## Preparing the Virtual Machine Hard Drive
Installing [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) on a VM is kind of a bitch since they don't provide a real ISO image. 
It's actually a **raw disk/USB image mislabeled `.iso`**, meant to be written 1:1 to a USB stick. That’s why VMware Fusion fails: it’s not a CD image.

For this reason, you need to install `qemu` first. You can either download from their [site](https://www.qemu.org/download/#macos) or just use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install it. 
Using homebrew is as simple as: `brew install qemu`

Afterwards, let's use qemu to convert the "ISO" image into a VMware-compatible disk. Navigate to where your disk image lives and run this command:
```bash
qemu-img convert -f raw -O vmdk omarchy-3.0.1.iso omarchy-3.0.1.vmdk
```

Afterwards you should see a `omarchy-3.0.1.vmdk` file (or whatever you end up naming it) in the location you ran the command from.

## Running on VMWare Fusion

Then, open [[VMWare Fusion]] and click on the "Create a Custom Virtual Machine" option and follow along:

For the OS you can choose "Other Linux 6"

Then for the Virtual Disk make sure you select the one we just created

Wow it still didn't work. This is because Apple silicon only supports UEFI firmware, whereas I need legacy BIOS firmware to run Omarchy.

## Running with UTM/QEMU
Alright the only option left is to try running it with UTM/QEMU on macOS. It's the easiest way on mac to boot BIOS-only images.
Only because now I'm being stubborn and just want to get it figured out for the sake of figuring it out. I bet I won't even like Omarchy but that's not the point any more.

First install UTM [from their site](https://mac.getutm.app/), it's basically a GUI for QEMU

After some tinkering I got it to work!

Steps I took:
1. When you create a new VM, choose **EMULATE** (not virtualize) and for the OS select "Other"
2. MAKE SURE TO SET ARCHITECTURE TO `x86_64`. 
3. MAKE SURE TO SET SYSTEM TO LATEST `Q35`
You need to select **"Expert Mode"** to see these options:

4. Select the Drive Image (the ISO file from their website) and MAKE SURE TO UNCHECK UEFI (Since we want to use classic BIOS)
![[Pasted image 20250929142625.png|400]]
5. Then once the VM is created, right click the VM and select "Edit"
![[Pasted image 20250929142802.png|300]]
And click the "New" button at the bottom under "Drives"
![[Pasted image 20250929142950.png|400]]
I added a 20gb drive IDE drive (I think in the future you could make this process even better by adding the ISO as a removable drive later, but for now this works)
![[Pasted image 20250929143026.png|300]]

Then finally start the VM (start from the 7BG drive) and select to install to the 20GB drive. 
The install takes a while so don't be surprised if you're waiting a bit. (We had to virtualize the chipset instructions from `ARM` to `x86_64`)

Additionally, here's what my UTM settings look like in case it helps:
