>[!hint] See [[Omarchy Mac VM Install]] for MacOS instructions

I'm going to install using the [vanilla Arch ISO](https://archlinux.org/download/), and then following [steps in this guide](https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual/96/manual-installation)

So in VMWare Workstation:
1. File -> New Virtual Machine
2. Select "Typical (recommended)" for configs
3. Installer Disk Image File (ISO) -> Select your arch ISO
4. For version, the site says "Included Kernel 6.16.8" so select "Other Linux 6.x kernel 64 bit". 
5. Set name and location. 
	1. I set name to `Arch-Omarchy-VM`
	2. I set location to `C:\Users\nader\Development\Virtual Machines`
6. I set Disk Size to 40GB and stored it as a SINGLE FILE

Additionally, before I started the VM i went into the VM settings and gave the VM 
- 8 gigs of RAM
- Added new Hard Disk: NVMe, that uses the old hard disk location at
	- `C:\Users\nader\Development\Virtual Machines\Arch-Omarchy-VM.vmdk`
- Enabled Accelerated Graphics under "Display" and set GPU memory to max (8gb for me)
- Go to "Options" tab, then under "Advnaced" look for "Firmware Type" and switch to UEFI. MAKE SURE TO TURN OFF "Enable Secure Boot" as Arch ISO won't boot with Secure Boot enabled.

Now you can finally boot the system. Don't be confused that you're booted into zsh, as this is expected since we are booting into a live environment. Read the [pre-installation configs docs here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide#Boot_the_live_environment) 

You can double check that your internet is working with a quick ping command:
```bash
ping ping.archlinux.org
```

Once you are satisfied, go ahead and run the [following command](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archinstall):
```bash
archinstall
```

> [!bug] if you are noticing an issue with input handling
> `archinstall` uses a TUI (Text User Interface) that has a known quirk with VMWare. 
> 
> In shell, VMWare passes raw key events, but in TUI it switches from terminal to raw/alternate screen mode, which then means VMWare uses it's enhanced keyboard, which can sometimes inject ghost scancodes. 
> 
> To fix this, just disable the enhanced keyboard. Power off the VM -> Settings -> Options -> Advanced and set `Enhanced Virtual Keyboard` to OFF
