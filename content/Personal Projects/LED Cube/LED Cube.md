[1000pcs F5 5mm Round White Clear Led Super Bright Ligte Emitting Diodes 6000-6500k Lamp Bulb](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806931796890.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.53.4b7b1802aY1G3X&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa#nav-specification)

White 
voltage = ~3.2-3.4
luminance (mcd) = 12000-14000
wave band (nm, k) = 6000~6500k

What is the actual current we can run through these LEDs? 80mW is lower power dissipation, let's check. 

According to Ohms law, P = V x I 
P = Power (watts)
V = Voltage (volts)
I = Current (amps)

## Resistor?
Because power max is **80mW**, that actually limits you:

At 3.4V:
I = P/V 
I = 0.08W / 3.4V = 23.5mA

So even though it says 30mA max, **23mA is the real thermal limit** if you don’t want to shorten lifespan.

So this means we should run 23mA max if we want to play it safe. LEDs cube usually run 10-15ma anyway

For the resistors
Voltage across resistor:
5−3.4=1.6V5 - 3.4 = 1.6V5−3.4=1.6V
### 🎯 10mA (safe, cube-friendly)
R=1.6/0.01=160ΩR = 1.6 / 0.01 = 160ΩR=1.6/0.01=160Ω
Use **180Ω** (standard value)
### 🎯 15mA (bright, still safe)
R=1.6/0.015=106ΩR = 1.6 / 0.015 = 106ΩR=1.6/0.015=106Ω
Use **120Ω** (safer than 110Ω)
### 🎯 20mA (near practical max)
R=1.6/0.02=80ΩR = 1.6 / 0.02 = 80ΩR=1.6/0.02=80Ω
Use **82Ω**

with 180ohm:

Running at:
- 10mA → bright
- 15mA → very bright
- 20mA → very bright, shorter lifespan
- 30mA → pushing it

# Why are we choosing 8–12mA instead of 20–30mA?

### The 74HC595 is the bottleneck.
Each output pin of a 74HC595:
- Is happiest at around **6–8mA**
- Can technically go higher
- But total chip current is limited

If you try to run 20mA per LED:
- Voltage droops
- Chip heats up
- Brightness becomes uneven
- Things behave weirdly

> We are intentionally choosing lower current because of the shift register.

# The Build
First of all, you shuold really create a jig to hold the LEDs in place. For my first prototype cube I'm going to use foam, but I'm telling you from personal experience foam is NOT the optimal choice. I will create a 3d printed rig once I get to the final build.

You want to bend the cathodes in the same direction and have each row connect all cathodes together. 

Then you'll want to connect each row of cathodes to a single rail, like so
![[Pasted image 20260223111429.png]]

After you finish with your first layer you should have something like this. 1 cathode end with 25 anode ends. Each layer will have 1 cathode lead.

# Misc
I bought some cool looking LED bulbs called "Edison bulbs" and I want to try making something cool with them. Don't know what yet.
