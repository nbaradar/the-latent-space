CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) allows your frontend and backend to run on different origins (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend and `http://127.0.0.1:8000` for the backend).
#### **Advantages of CORS**
1. **Simplified Development**:
    - Running the frontend and backend on different origins simplifies development, as they can be started independently and use their respective dev servers.
2. **Realistic for Production**:
    - In production, you may host your frontend (e.g., on a CDN or a platform like Netlify) and backend (e.g., on AWS or Azure) on separate domains. Setting up CORS during development mirrors this setup.
3. **Microservices or Distributed Architecture**:
    - If you plan to extend ContextCore into a distributed system with multiple APIs or frontend services, CORS becomes essential.
4. **Flexibility**:
    - Easier to switch frontend frameworks or backend implementations without tightly coupling them.
#### **How to Set Up CORS in FastAPI**

Add CORS middleware to your FastAPI app:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app = FastAPI()

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000"],  # Frontend dev server
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],  # Allow all HTTP methods
    allow_headers=["*"],  # Allow all headers
)

```
