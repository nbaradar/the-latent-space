Let's integrate MongoDB so the exported result.json file gets stored in a database called "MultiQuery" in the collection "result" 

Things you need to do...
- Setup the database
- Add connection info to config file
- Create mongodb util for CRUD operations
- Modify export functionality to include MongoDB CRUD

First of all, installing MongoDB on mac is different. 
Remember where you store your mongod.conf file, you need to use it when starting the DB:
```bash
mongod --config /usr/local/mongodb/mongod.conf
```
