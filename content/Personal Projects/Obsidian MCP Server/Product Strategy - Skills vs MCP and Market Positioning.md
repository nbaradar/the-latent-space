# Product Strategy: Skills vs MCP and Market Positioning

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Context:** Strategic discussion about Obsidian MCP Server architecture, Skills integration, and market positioning

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Skills Cannot Replace MCP Servers

**Core Distinction:**
- **MCP Servers:** Execute code, access filesystem, return dynamic data, maintain state
- **Skills:** Read-only documentation that Claude reads at runtime to improve tool usage

**Skills with executable code exist** (using `bash_tool`), but converting our tools would be strictly worse:
- ❌ Lose security sandboxing (path traversal protection)
- ❌ Lose stateful sessions (active vault tracking)
- ❌ Lose type safety (parameters become string parsing)
- ❌ Lose structured errors (get Python tracebacks instead)
- ❌ Lose UI integration (tools hidden in markdown)

**Verdict:** Keep all 22 MCP tools as-is. They're core infrastructure, not utilities.

---

## What Skills Should Provide

Skills complement MCP servers by providing **workflow patterns and best practices** without bloating the context window.

### Recommended Skill Structure

```markdown
# /mnt/skills/user/obsidian-vault/SKILL.md

## Core Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Discovery Before Retrieval
✅ search_obsidian_notes → verify → retrieve
❌ retrieve directly → FileNotFoundError

### Pattern 2: Token-Efficient Content Search
✅ search_obsidian_content (snippets) → selective retrieval
❌ list_all → retrieve_all (burns tokens)

### Pattern 3: Structured Edits
✅ append_to_section_obsidian_note
❌ retrieve → modify → replace (expensive)
```

**What Skills add:**
- 📚 Multi-step workflow examples
- 📚 Token efficiency patterns
- 📚 Vault-specific conventions
- 📚 Error recovery strategies
- 🔧 Specialized utility scripts (backlink analysis, etc.)

**What Skills don't replace:**
- Core CRUD operations
- Security validation
- Session state management
- Type-safe parameters

---

## Market Positioning Strategy

### The Rebrand Question

**Decision: Keep "Obsidian MCP Server"**

**Why?**
1. **SEO & Discoverability:** "Obsidian MCP" has high search volume
2. **Marketing > Technical Accuracy:** Obsidian has 1M+ users as distribution channel
3. **Code is already universal:** Works with any markdown folder (Logseq, Foam, Dendron, plain folders)
4. **"PKM" is niche:** Most people don't know the abbreviation
5. **Positioning:** "Obsidian-compatible" rather than "Obsidian-exclusive"

**Strategy:**
- Keep the Obsidian brand for discoverability
- Clarify in README that it works with any markdown system
- Use "vault" terminology (clearer than "workspace" or "folder")
- Position as "Built for Obsidian, works universally"

---

## Competitive Analysis

### What Actually Exists

**Generic Filesystem Servers:**
- Basic CRUD (read_file, write_file, list_directory)
- ❌ No markdown awareness
- ❌ No structural operations

**Obsidian Local REST API Servers:**
- Requires Obsidian running
- ❌ No heading-based operations
- ❌ Limited functionality

**Other Markdown Servers:**
- Basic CRUD only
- ❌ No vault concept
- ❌ No multi-vault sessions
- ❌ No frontmatter tools

### Our Unique Value Proposition

**Only server with:**
1. ✅ Heading-based structural editing (semantic, not line-based)
2. ✅ Token-efficient snippet search (preview before full retrieval)
3. ✅ Multi-vault session management (stateful context)
4. ✅ Frontmatter as first-class citizen (YAML manipulation)
5. ✅ Backlink updating on move/rename
6. ✅ Works without Obsidian running
7. ✅ Security built-in (path traversal protection, vault sandboxing)

**Key Differentiator:** Markdown-native operations vs. treating .md files like .txt

---

## Token Economics

### Current Tool Definition Cost
- 22 tools × ~400 tokens/tool = ~8,800 tokens
- Loaded **once per session** and cached
- This is **negligible** compared to:
  - Conversation history: ~20K tokens
  - Single note retrieval: ~5K tokens
  - Claude's system prompt: ~50K tokens

**Conclusion:** Tool definitions aren't the bottleneck. Skills optimize supplementary documentation, not core tool defs.

### Token Efficiency by Design

**Example: Content Search**
- Full retrieval of 10 notes: **~50,000 tokens** 💸
- Snippet search with our server: **~1,500 tokens** ✅

**Pattern:**
```python
search_obsidian_content("machine learning")  # Returns snippets
# Review snippets, identify best 1-2 matches
retrieve_obsidian_note("AI/ML Notes")  # Full content only for relevant notes
```

---

## Updated README Strategy

### New Tagline
```markdown
# 🧠 Obsidian MCP Server
**Structure-aware markdown operations for Claude Desktop**

> Built for Obsidian, works with any markdown folder. The only MCP server with 
> heading-based editing, token-efficient search, and frontmatter as a first-class citizen.
```

### Key Sections to Add

#### 1. "Why This Server?"
Comparison table showing:
- Generic server: Replace entire file
- This server: `insert_after_heading` (semantic)

#### 2. "What Makes This Different"
Five unique capabilities:
1. Heading-based navigation (stable semantic anchors)
2. Token-efficient by design (snippet search)
3. Multi-vault sessions (stateful context)
4. Frontmatter as first-class (YAML manipulation)
5. Security from day one (sandboxing, validation)

#### 3. "Comparison with Other Solutions"
- vs. Obsidian Local REST API
- vs. Generic Filesystem Servers
- vs. Other Markdown Servers

#### 4. "Who Should Use This"
- ✅ Obsidian, Logseq, Foam, Dendron users
- ✅ Anyone with markdown notes
- ✅ Developers building PKM automations
- ❌ Not for: Binary files, real-time collaboration

#### 5. "Compatibility"
Examples showing vaults.yaml config for:
- Obsidian vaults
- Logseq graphs
- Foam workspaces
- Plain markdown folders

→ search_obsidian_content("transformer")
→ Review snippets
→ retrieve_obsidian_note("AI/ML Fundamentals")  # Only relevant match
```

### Vault Reorganization
```
User: "Move 'Old Project' to Archive"
→ move_obsidian_note(
    "Projects/Old Project",
    "Archive/Old Project",
    update_links=True  # Updates backlinks automatically
  )
```

---

## Implementation Decisions

### ✅ Keep as "Obsidian MCP Server"
- Better SEO and discoverability
- Obsidian community as distribution channel
- Code already works universally
- Just clarify compatibility in docs

### ✅ All 22 Tools Stay in MCP
- They're core infrastructure, not utilities
- Security, state, type safety all depend on MCP
- Token cost is negligible (~9K, cached)
- Converting would be strictly worse

### ✅ Add Skills for Workflow Patterns
- Multi-step workflow examples
- Token efficiency best practices
- Vault-specific conventions
- Specialized utility scripts (optional)

### ✅ Focus on Distribution
- Product is great, awareness is the gap
- Multi-channel outreach (forum, Reddit, Twitter)
- Demo assets to show the magic moment
- Position uniqueness clearly

## Why This Server?

**Generic filesystem servers** treat markdown like text files.  
**This server** understands markdown structure.

| Operation | Generic Server | This Server |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Add content | Replace entire file | `insert_after_heading` |
| Find notes | Full-text search | Snippet preview → selective retrieval |
| Update metadata | Parse YAML manually | `update_obsidian_frontmatter` |
| Rename notes | Just move file | Move + update all backlinks |

**Result:** 10× fewer tokens, semantic operations, no fragile line-number edits.

---

## What Makes This Different

### 1. 🎯 **Heading-Based Navigation** (Unique)
Traditional editors use line numbers—they break when content changes.  
This server uses **semantic anchors** (headings) that remain stable.

```markdown
## Meeting Notes
Content here

### Action Items
- Task 1
```

**With this server:**
```python
append_to_section_obsidian_note(
    title="2025-10-27",
    heading="Action Items",
    content="- New task"
)
```
**→ Adds task in the right place, no line counting**

### 2. 💰 **Token-Efficient by Design** (Unique)
Searching 10 notes with full retrieval: **~50,000 tokens** 💸  
Searching with this server: **~1,500 tokens** ✅

```python
search_obsidian_content("machine learning")
# Returns snippets with context, not full files
# Then retrieve only the 1-2 relevant notes
```

### 3. 🔄 **Multi-Vault Sessions** (Unique)
```python
set_active_vault("work")
# All subsequent operations use work vault
# No need to repeat vault parameter
```
**→ Stateful context that persists**

### 4. 📋 **Frontmatter as First-Class** (Rare)
```python
update_obsidian_frontmatter("note", {"draft": false})
# Merges into existing frontmatter
# Preserves other fields
# Validates YAML structure
```

### 5. 🔒 **Security from Day One** (Critical)
- Path traversal protection
- Vault sandboxing
- No arbitrary filesystem access
- All operations logged

---

## Comparison with Other Solutions

### vs. Obsidian Local REST API
**Their approach:** Requires Obsidian running, limited operations  
**This server:** Works offline, full structural editing

### vs. Generic Filesystem Servers
**Their approach:** Treat .md files like .txt  
**This server:** Markdown-native, structure-aware

### vs. Other Markdown Servers
**Their approach:** Basic CRUD, no vault concept  
**This server:** Multi-vault sessions, heading navigation, token efficiency

---

## 🔄 Compatibility

This server works with any markdown-based system:

### Obsidian
```yaml
vaults:
  my-vault:
    path: "/Users/you/Documents/ObsidianVault"
    description: "Primary personal vault"
```

### Logseq
```yaml
vaults:
  logseq-graph:
    path: "/Users/you/Documents/logseq"
    description: "Logseq daily notes"
    # Logseq uses journals/ and pages/ - works fine!
```

### Foam (VS Code)
```yaml
vaults:
  foam-workspace:
    path: "/Users/you/Documents/foam-workspace"
    description: "Foam workspace"
```

### Plain Markdown
```yaml
vaults:
  notes:
    path: "/Users/you/Documents/notes"
    description: "Any folder with .md files works"
```

---

## Who Should Use This

✅ **Obsidian users** who want Claude to manage their vaults  
✅ **Logseq users** who work with markdown files  
✅ **Foam/Dendron users** with VS Code workspaces  
✅ **Anyone** with a folder of markdown notes  
✅ **Developers** building PKM automations  

❌ **Not for:** Binary files, non-markdown content, real-time collaboration

## 🎬 Real-World Workflows

### Daily Journaling
```
User: "Add today's gratitude entry"
Claude: append_to_section_obsidian_note(
    "Daily/2025-10-27", 
    heading="Gratitude",
    content="- Grateful for productive morning"
)
```

### Research Note Management
```
User: "Find all notes mentioning 'transformer architecture'"
Claude: search_obsidian_content("transformer")
# Reviews snippets, identifies 2 relevant notes
# Retrieves only those 2, not all matches
```

### Vault Reorganization
```
User: "Move 'Old Project' to Archive folder"
Claude: move_obsidian_note(
    "Projects/Old Project",
    "Archive/Old Project",
    update_links=True  # Updates all backlinks across vault
)
```

## 🏗️ Design Principles

### 1. **Token Efficiency First**
Every tool is designed to minimize context window usage:
- Snippet-based search over full-content retrieval
- Heading-based navigation over full-file reads
- Combined operations over multiple tool calls

### 2. **Markdown-Native Operations**
Traditional editors use line numbers. This breaks with note edits. **Semantic anchors** (headings) remain stable as content changes.

### 3. **Session-Aware Context**
Claude can switch between vaults mid-conversation without losing state.

*"Update my work vault... actually, check my personal vault first"* — just works.

2. All 22 tools stay in MCP (they're core infrastructure)
3. Add Skills for workflow patterns and best practices
4. Focus on distribution: product is great, awareness is the gap
5. Position as unique: no other server has heading-ops + snippets + sessions

**Unique Value:** Markdown-native operations that understand structure, not just text.

**Next Focus:** Distribution and community outreach to reach the 1M+ Obsidian users who could benefit from this.
